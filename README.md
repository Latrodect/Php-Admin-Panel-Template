# Login,Mail and General Controller PHP Website Template


Start building your great site! This template includes general settings management of your website, user registration and md5 encryption and session-based user login. It includes automatic login page forwarding operations, dynamic menu creation system and php mail sending and smtp controller interface. You can easily make it ready for use by adding your own dynamic widget system. The database used in php coding on phpmyadmin is located in the github file.

When you create your own databases, you can make the necessary updates by looking at the database backup or continue to develop over the existing database.
